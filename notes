what is babel 
-> Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that converts edge JavaScript
 into plain old ES5 JavaScript that can run in any browser (even the old ones).
  It makes available all the syntactical sugar that was added to JavaScript with
   the new ES6 specification, including classes, fat arrows and multiline strings.

what is webpack ?
Webpack is a tool that lets you compile JavaScript modules,
 also known as module bundler. Given a large number of files,
  it generates a single file (or a few files) that run your app. 
  It can perform many operations: helps you bundle your resources.
   ... allows you to use require() for CSS files.

Webpack is a static module bundler for JavaScript applications â€” it takes 
all the code from your application and makes it usable in a web browser.
 Modules are reusable chunks of code built from your app's JavaScript,
  node_modules, images, and the CSS styles which are packaged to be easily 
  used in your website.
